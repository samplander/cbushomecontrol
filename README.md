# cbusHomeControl

cbusHomeControl is a web application designed to provide convenient control and monitoring of a C-Bus home automation system. The app runs in a web browser and allows users to interact with their smart home devices, such as lights, switches, and sensors, from any device on the local network.

## Features
- Control C-Bus connected devices (e.g., lights, switches)
- Monitor device status in real time
- Simple, user-friendly web interface
- Works on desktop and mobile browsers

## How It Works
1. The app communicates with the C-Bus system via a backend or gateway (not included in this repository).
2. Users access the app through their browser (open `index.html`).
3. The app displays available devices and their statuses, allowing users to toggle or adjust them as needed.
4. Changes made in the app are sent to the C-Bus system, updating the physical devices accordingly.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure your C-Bus system is accessible on your network.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to connect and control your devices.
